# Space Invaders

Play Space Invaders in your browser! (Well, move your spaceship and watch enemies approach you; there's no bullets flying yet).

## Play

Hosted version of [the game is here](https://thekevinscott.github.io/space-invaders/).

Move your spaceship using the left or right arrow keys. You can also use "h" and "l" because Vim is awesome. Make sure your browser window has focus.

## Requirements
Please use the latest version of Chrome or Safari.

The code uses uncompiled ES6 modules, which are supported natively in Chrome 61+ and Safari 11+
